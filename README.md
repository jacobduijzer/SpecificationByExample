# Specification By Example Demo

## Introduction

I have a small API, running as a Docker container. It is a basic sample of a REST API which can be used in a web shop. 

## Demonstration

1. [Swagger page](http://localhost/swagger)
2. Get products (Get category, search cat + title)
3. Verify results
4. Go though the specifications, first Dutch, then English
5. Run tests from IDE
6. run from CLI, view report
7. Add extra step, verify total cost of the order
