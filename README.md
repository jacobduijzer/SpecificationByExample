# Specification By Example Demo

## Introduction

I have a small API, running as a Docker container. It is a basic sample of a REST API which can be used in a web shop. 

## Demonstration

1. Go to the folder `webshop`.
2. Run the API in Docker: `docker-compose up`.
3. Test if the API is working, go to the  [Swagger page](http://localhost:8000/swagger).
4. Run the `cicd.sh` script to test and generate the living documentation.
